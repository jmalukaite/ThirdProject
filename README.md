# 3.0 Version
## What's new?
1. An exec file for a user to use was created (the file is named 1_5 because the code is imported from 1.5 version).
2. An installer file is created (MyPacks).

### exec
The file was created by linking necessary libraries and files of a project in the terminal (this could be also done in the CMakeList). 

### MyPacks
Because the version is programmed on Macbook operating system (macos) using CLion, the installer creation was completely different from the one on Windows using Visual Studio. Firsly, WhiteBox Packages tool was downloaded to the computer and permission for installation was given. Secondly, a folder called MyPacks was created on Desktop. When the program was downloaded, the exec file was imported to the Packages and MyPacks folder was selected. Finally, an installer file for a user was created.
